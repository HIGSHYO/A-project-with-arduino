# A-project-with-arduino
This is a little pessoal project using arduino mega 2560 to make an device that activates a hydraulic piston using 3 infrared sensor to capt movement and 1 infrared sensor to be an reference to the other ones i'm using a DHT to register temperature and humidity between the "tests" and a ESP to send the data to an clound storage to save all tests.
